`OldLEDDARConfig.lto` is the configuration for a LEDDAR Dev Kit leddar, this is
the one that has been on Chomp for most of testing. It was destroyed in the
fight with HUGE, this configuration file was recovered as was the screen shot
`LeddarConfigurationWindow.png`.

The new LEDDAR in the spares kit has a different sensor, and loading
`OldLEDDARConfig.lto` results in a `File Format Error`. I copied the
configuration by making the Acquistion config window look just like it did for
the old leddar, plus the new options not available for that module. I then
saved the new configuration as `NewLEDDARConfig.lto`.
